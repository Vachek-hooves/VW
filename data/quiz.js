    misticStory:
      "In the very heart of Austria, on the shores of the picturesque lake Velden am Wörthersee, there is an ancient city that hides the secret of a long-forgotten treasure. Legend has it that in ancient times, a local sorcerer cursed the treasure and covered it with an eternal veil of mist so that no one could find it without the right key.  There is a story about a young daredevil named Albert, who decided to solve this mystery and find the treasure. After long research and adventurous search, he came across an ancient map that promised treasure deposits in the depths of the lake. On the night before the full moon, when the fog enveloped the city, Albert set out on a boat to the waters of the lake. Swimming in the direction marked on the map, he suddenly saw a light shining from under the water. Picking up the ancient treasure chest, he heard the voice of the magician: 'You have passed the test and overcome the obstacles, but remember that the treasure carries not only wealth, but also great responsibility.' Returning to the city with the treasure, Albert became the protector of Velden am Wörter See, using the wealth for the good of the residents and the lake. Since that time, the city has flourished, and the legend of the treasure and the brave hero lives on in people's hearts as a symbol of hope and faith in goodness.",

    misticStory:
      "Velden am Wörter See, a picturesque town surrounded by the Alps and located by a magical lake, has always been known for its mystery and legends of ghosts. One of the most famous legends is related to an ancient castle that stood on top of a mountain with a wonderful view of the lake.    The castle once belonged to a powerful family that ruled these lands. However, one dark day, when storm clouds covered the peaks of the Alps, the castle turned out to be shrouded in mystery. Later, rumors were heard that the souls of the deceased relatives of the castle's owners roamed its corridors and towers. One day, a young researcher named Anna decided to investigate this legend. She arrived in Velden am Wörter See to reveal the secret of the castle and to answer the question of the existence of ghosts. Through research and conversations with local residents, she learns of an ancient legend of love, betrayal, and a curse woven into the fate of this place. After many nights spent in the castle, during which Anna listened to the whispering of the wind and strange sounds, she perceived the presence of unseen forces. In the end, she met the ghosts, who told her about their tragic history and how they stayed in their former home until a way to break the curse was found. Through her ingenuity and mental life experience, Anna was able to uncover the true nature of the curse and help the ghosts find peace. Her research became the basis for many books and legends about the castle in Velden am Wörter See and its otherworldly inhabitants. ",

    misticStory:
      "The town of Velden am Wörter See has always been famous for its beauty and tranquility, but behind the deep idyll lay a dark and mysterious history. The legend of the curse began in ancient times, when the city experienced a period of great fever that claimed the lives of many residents. According to legend, one of the local magicians, who was denied treatment for his beloved, decided to take revenge on the city's residents. He uttered a curse that turned on the entire community: 'Until justice is restored and forgiveness is expressed, the city of Velden am Wörter See will be under a curse - darkness and misery will accompany its inhabitants.' Strange events began in the city: people disappeared without a trace, diseases spread faster than usual, and clouds resembling skulls often appeared in the sky. Residents began to panic and look for ways to dilute this curse.   Over the centuries, a number of generations have tried to break the curse, but without success. However, everything changed when a young woman named Anna arrived in town. She was a scientist and magician who decided to accept the challenge and solve the mystery of the curse. Anna researched ancient scrolls and artifacts, performed complex rituals and meditations. Gradually, she realized that the key to solving the curse lay in the forgiveness and mutual understanding of the inhabitants.Through Anna's efforts and the support of the community, the residents began to forgive each other for past grievances and misunderstandings. This act of kindness and simplicity helped lift the curse from the city. Velden am Wörter See came alive with new life: the people became happy and peaceful, and the curse was a thing of the past. Anna remained in the city as a symbol of hope and liberation from the past.",

However, over time, the hotel began to become empty, and its walls began to peel off, reminding of its past greatness. Local residents told a legend about the souls of deceased guests who stayed in this hotel, trying to find peace. It was said that at night you can hear whispers and knocks on doors, and sometimes see the faint outlines of ghosts wandering the corridors. One day, a young artist named Liliana arrived in the city to find inspiration for her paintings. She felt attracted by the mysterious hotel and its history, so she decided to stay there for a few weeks. Liliana worked on a series of paintings in which she tried to immortalize the souls of deceased hotel guests. Spending many nights in this place, she felt an extraordinary energy and artistic inspiration that she had not known before. Gradually, Liliana began to perceive the presence of ghosts, which informed her of her tragic fate and desire to find peace. With the help of her artistic creativity, she was able to convey their essence and help them find peace. At the end of her stay at the hotel, Liliana created an unparalleled collection of paintings, which became a kind of memory of the souls of deceased guests.
